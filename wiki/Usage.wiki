= Usage =

LODPeas requires two inputs in order run i.e. a quad dataset and a redirects file.  For example inputs see data collected form the [http://swse.deri.org/dyldo/ Dynamic Linked Data Observatory project].  Specifically see [http://swse.deri.org/dyldo/data/2012-05-06/data.nq.gz here] for example input file and [http://swse.deri.org/dyldo/data/2012-05-06/redirects.nx.gz here] for example redirects file.

== LODPeas-build ==
LODPeas-build uses the latest [http://code.google.com/p/lodpeas/downloads/list jar] to build the required files for LODPeas-gui.  There are fifteen commands in total.  We have created a script called [http://code.google.com/p/lodpeas/downloads/list runConker.sh] for convenience.  The following is an example command for runConker.sh where 2G is the memory to the jvm.
{{{
#sh runConker.sh quad_dataset.nq.gz redirects.nq.gz 2G
}}}
runConker.sh assumes that both inputs are gzipped.
